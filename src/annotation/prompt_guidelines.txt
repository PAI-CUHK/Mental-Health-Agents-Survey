You are a medical AI researcher. You are doing a literature review for mental health agents paper. 
###Task
Given a paper’s PDF content, please follow the annotation guidelines below to extract the proper attribute for each dimension.
Identify each attribute based on explicit evidence in the text. If information is insufficient, choose the most conservative/general option (e.g., "unspecified_ai", "no_evaluation").
Do not make unsupported assumptions.


###Step-by-Step Annotation Instructions:
1. Read the title and abstract to understand the system’s purpose, users, mental health relevance, and technical design.
2. Scan the PDF for details on architecture, tasks, data, LLM usage, evaluation, and autonomy.
3. Before assigning tags, you should extract 2–3 supporting evidence snippets strictly from the paper.
4. Assign tags strictly from the provided lists, using the evidence collected. For each tag, return only the most relevant single piece of supporting evidence.
4. Output the title and results in JSON format, following the exact schema provided.


I. System Type
Guidelines: For the System Type tag, you will be given five sub-tags. 
Guidelines for supporting evidence: For 'Base Model' tag, directly give the model used. For others tag, give the most relevant evidence directly quote from the paper.
i. Base Model - Describes how to categorize the underly types of the model, you can only choose one answer that applies.
  1. Rule-based models – Models that rely on predefined if–then rules or decision trees, with no statistical learning from data.
  2. Machine Learning Models – Non-deep-learning statistical models that learn patterns from data, such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines.
  3. Deep Learning Models – Neural network–based models with multiple layers (e.g., CNNs, RNNs)
  4. Small pre-trained model – Small-scale models trained to directly applied to downstream tasks, it balances performance with efficiency and can run on edge devices. (e.g., BERT models, etc.).
  5. Foundation model - Large-scale model trained on a vast dataset so that it can be applied across a wide range of use cases (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA, Claude, etc.).

ii. Interface Type - Describes how the system interacts with humans, you can only choose one answer that applies.
  1. Chatbot – Single conversational interface, dialogue-driven.
  2. Non-Chat Agent – No direct chat; operates via API calls, background automation, or scheduled tasks.

iii. Workflow Composition - Describe what roles agents play in the system, you can only choose one answer that applies.
  1. Non-Agent - Single-pass or scripted logic; no autonomous planning or tool use.
  2. Single Agent – One LLM agent handles all tasks.
  3. Multi-Agent – Multiple agents with defined roles in a coordinated workflow. If is the multi-agent system, choose one of the system architectures below and give the relevant supporting evidence and if the paper provides architecture figures, directly quotes the figure number.
    - Flat Architecture – All agents operate at the same level without hierarchy.
    - Hierarchical Architecture – One or more supervisor agents manage subordinate agents.
    - Team Architecture – Peers collaborate, possibly with specialized roles, but without strict hierarchy.
    - Society Architecture – Large-scale network of agents with emergent behaviors and multi-role interactions.
    - Hybrid Architecture – Combination of the above patterns.

iv. Agentic Role - Describe the role that the Agent owns in the system, you should select all answers that apply - if you cannot find relevant options, choose "Other".
  1. Retrieval - Accessing the relevant information from structured or unstructured sources, such as EHR and medical knowledge base.
  2. Personalization - Tailoring responses or recommendations based on individual patient characteristics such as patient demographics, medical history or preferences.
  3. Risk assessment - Evaluating the factual correctness, bias, or hallucination in LLM-generated responses, and assessing the effectiveness of the system.
  4. Tool use - Refining previous model performance by integrating external tools such as the implementation of MCP.
  5. Other

II. Data Scope
Guidelines: For the Data Attributes tag, you should return the outputs based on the detailed instructions below.
i. Data Modality - Select all data modalities explicitly used in the paper. Do not infer based only on model architecture or tensor shapes — look for explicit mentions (e.g., “images,” “video clips,” “speech,” “text transcripts”). Particularly be aware of the reinforcement learning or gird world environment, they may not use the image data.
  1. Text
  2. Audio
  3. Images
  4. Video
ii. Source of training data - For each paper, select all applicable data types used as training input (NOT the data used for evaluation). If a top-level category is selected, you must also select at least one of its subcategories. Do not select a parent category alone. Be rigorous in your annotation—ensure that subcategories accurately reflect the data described in the paper.
  1. Clinical - Data generated during clinical care or medical assessment. Typically recorded by professionals. 
      - Electronic Health Records (EHRs) - Structured and unstructured data in clinical systems, this may include diagnoses results, medications, clinical notes, etc.
      - Lab Test - Results of biological/medical lab testing, this may include blood panels, imaging reports, etc.
  2. Elicited Evidence - Information directly reported by individuals about their own symptoms, thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.
      - Interview (Questionnaire) - Structured or semi-structured questionnaire where participants answer specific questions.
      - Systematic reviews  / Meta analysis - Standardized instruments (often validated) collecting responses from individuals of a particular topic. It may include meta analysis by conducting statistical methods.
      - Random Controlled Trial (RCT) - Measures the efficacy of an intervention or treatment
      - Cohort Study -  compares people who have the specified condition or outcome being studied with people who do not have the condition or outcome.
      - Case Series and Reports - Detailed report of the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, treatment response, and follow-up after treatment of an individual patient.
      - Cross-Sectional Study / Prevalence study - examines subjects at a single point in time (e.g. survey of a population to determine the prevalence of lung cancer).
  3. Interactional / Conversational - Data from human-human or human-agent or human-chatbot interactions, especially dialogues reflecting behavioral or mental states. e.g., Therapy session transcripts, Human-chatbot conversations
  4. Generated / Synthetic - Data created fully or partially by language models or simulation frameworks. e.g. LLM-generated dialogues, simulated patient records


III. Mental Health Focus (select all that apply)
Guideline: This tag follows the ICD-11 International Classification of Diseases. The number before is the ICD-11 code. You should assign the lowest applicable hierarchy code if the source provides sufficient supporting evidence. If no evidence supports a more specific subcategory, select the appropriate higher-level parent category instead. For papers that address general mental health issues or a broad range of mental health conditions without focusing on a specific diagnosis, use “General Psychiatry” as the only tag rather than tagging individual ICD-11 categories. The final output contains the code and disease name as an answer, e.g. “6A0 - Neurodevelopmental Disorders”.
